# bb-superbuild

This is a meta repository (so-called "superbuild") that uses [CMake](https://cmake.org/) and [YCM](https://github.com/robotology/ycm) to automatically
download and compile software developed in the baesian balancer GitHub organization. This superbuild is based on the [robotology-superbuild](https://github.com/robotology/robotology-superbuild)

[CMake](https://cmake.org/) is an open-source, cross-platform family of tools designed to build, test and package software.
A [YCM Superbuild](http://robotology.github.io/ycm/gh-pages/git-master/index.html#superbuild) is a CMake project whose only goal is to download and build several other projects.
If you are familiar with ROS, it is something similar to [catkin](http://wiki.ros.org/catkin/workspaces) or [colcon workspace](https://colcon.readthedocs.io/en/released/user/quick-start.html), but using pure CMake for portability reasons and for customizing the build via CMake options. 

<!-- Furthermore, the `robotology-superbuild` also contains some infrastructure to build **binaries** of the contained projects for some platforms. 
You can read more about the superbuild concept in [YCM documentation](http://robotology.github.io/ycm/gh-pages/latest/index.html) or in the [related IRC paper](http://lornat75.github.io/papers/2018/domenichelli-irc.pdf). -->
