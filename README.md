# Open Sim2Real superbuild for the monopod platform

This is a meta repository (so-called "superbuild") that uses [CMake](https://cmake.org/) and [YCM](https://github.com/robotology/ycm) to automatically
download and compile software developed in the OpenSim2Real GitHub organization. This superbuild is based on the [robotology-superbuild](https://github.com/robotology/robotology-superbuild)

[CMake](https://cmake.org/) is an open-source, cross-platform family of tools designed to build, test and package software.
A [YCM Superbuild](http://robotology.github.io/ycm/gh-pages/git-master/index.html#superbuild) is a CMake project whose only goal is to download and build several other projects.
If you are familiar with ROS, it is something similar to [catkin](http://wiki.ros.org/catkin/workspaces) or [colcon workspace](https://colcon.readthedocs.io/en/released/user/quick-start.html), but using pure CMake for portability reasons and for customizing the build via CMake options.

# Support
Currently ubuntu 20.04 is the only tested version.
