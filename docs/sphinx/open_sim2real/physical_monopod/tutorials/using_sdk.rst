Using the SDK
=====================

This tutorial will show the user how to use the robot SDK to create a cpp executable
that interfaces with the robot. This executable will both read and write with the robot
to perform a basic control task. The goal of this tutorial will be to provide a basic
understanding of the `monopod_sdk` API and how to use it to perform safe control.
