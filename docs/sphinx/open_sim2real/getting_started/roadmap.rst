Project Roadmap
===============

This project Roadmap follows the same form as the ROS roadmap.

This page described planned work for OpenSim2Real. The set of planned features
and development efforts give insight into the overall project direction and
development goals. To see other features added into the roadmap please reach out
to the :ref:`team <the_team>`.

Current Roadmap
===============

The roadmap hosts items that are major features being worked on by the OpenSim2Real team.
The “Size” is an estimated size of the task, where Small means person-days to complete,
Medium means person-weeks to complete, and Large means person-months to complete.

The roadmap is responsible for the high-level direction of the project. For more detail
feature status please view the :ref:`physical platform future development <future_development_physical>` and
:ref:`simulation platform future development <future_development_simulation>`
