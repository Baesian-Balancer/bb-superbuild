Why Open Sim2Real
=====================

The ability to do Sim2Real research is currently heavily limited by the lack of cheap,
low barrier of entry physical platforms. Currently most modern :ref:`Sim2Real <what_is_sim2real>`
involves expensive, large robots that are custom made by the research group. For most RL groups
manufacturing a custom robot is either too cumbersome or expensive, or limited by the knowledge gap
between robotics and machine learning.

By providing an open source complete platform for Sim2Real research that is relatively inexpensive we believe
it will open doors for research groups otherwise limited to simulation.
