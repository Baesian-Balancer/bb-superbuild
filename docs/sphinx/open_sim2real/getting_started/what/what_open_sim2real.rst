What's Open Sim2Real
====================

Open Sim2Real is a open source project striving to develop a simple cheap
platform for :ref:`Sim2Real <what_is_sim2real>` research.

The platform consists of a cheap :ref:`single leg robot <what_is_our_real>` constrained
to an approximate plane, and the corresponding simulation. Both the sim and real
components support training within the gym framework (limited by real-time constraints
on physical robot). In other words this project provides an open source, simple foundation
for future Sim2Real platforms to build on top of.

There are well documented `build instructions <building_the_robot>` for
the physical monopod, additionally instructions on how to install the software stack, set up
:ref:`training on cloud <training_on_cloud>` (with container or source), basic tasks and
reward functions, and much more. The project builds on top of many tools researchers are already
familiar with making the transition into real natural (those dang simulations need to touch grass).
