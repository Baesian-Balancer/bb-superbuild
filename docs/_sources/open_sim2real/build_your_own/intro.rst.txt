Introduction
================

This section contains all the information required to reproduce our platform.
There are two main components to this platform: the simulation gym environments,
and the real robot with its own gym environments.

The hardware platform has been completely based around the work done by the
`Open Dynamic Robot Initiative (ORDI) <https://open-dynamic-robot-initiative.github.io/>`_\ .
The packages we provide that are built around ORDI are: :ref:`monopod_sdk`, and all the hardware.
